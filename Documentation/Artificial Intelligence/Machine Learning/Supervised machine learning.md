## What is Supervised Machine Learning?
Supervised learning is a sort of machine learning in which machines are trained using well-labeled training data and then predict output based on that data. Labeled data indicates that some input data has already been marked with the correct output. In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines acts as a supervisor, teaching the machines to accurately predict the output. It employs the same principle that a student would learn under the supervision of a teacher.

Supervised learning is the process of supplying correct input and output data to a machine learning model. The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function that maps the input variable (x) to the output variable (y).

Supervised learning can be applied in the real world for risk assessment, image categorization, fraud detection, spam filtering, and so on.

## What Dataset is used by supervised machine learning?
 Simply put, supervised learning makes use of labelled input and output data. The algorithm "learns" from the training dataset by generating predictions on the data iteratively and adjusts for the correct response. While supervised learning models are more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require human interaction to identify the data correctly at the outset. A supervised learning model, for example, can anticipate how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions, and other factors. But first, you must educate it to recognise that rainy weather increases driving time.

## How to train the computer/system?

    1. Determine the type of training dataset first.
    2. Obtain the tagged training data.
    3. Divide the training dataset into three parts: training, test, and validation.
    4. Determine the training dataset's input features, which should contain enough knowledge for the model to accurately predict the output.
    5. Select an appropriate method for the model, such as support vector machine, decision tree, and so on.
    6. Run the algorithm on the practise dataset. Validation sets, which are subsets of training datasets, are sometimes required as control parameters.
    7. Provide the test set to evaluate the model's correctness. If the model predicts the correct outcome, our model is correct.

## Types of Algorithms:
  ### 1. Regression: 
  If there is a link between the input variable and the output variable, regression procedures are applied. It is used to forecast continuous variables such as weather, market trends, and so on. Some popular supervised learning regression algorithms are listed below:

    1. Linear Regression
    2. Regression Trees
    3. Non-Linear Regression
    4. Bayesian Linear Regression
    5. Polynomial Regression

  ### 2. Classification: 
  Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.

    1. Spam Filtering,
    2. Random Forest
    3. Decision Trees
    4. Logistic Regression
    5. Support vector Machines
